✓ Complex Queries (6.1-6.4): All 4 queries with joins and aggregations implemented
✓ Derived Attribute Query (7): Total cost calculation implemented
✓ View Operation (8): Job applications view created and queried
✓ All queries implemented using SQLAlchemy with textual SQL
✓ Results verified to be non-empty

Part 3: Web Application (40 points) - COMPLETED
✓ Flask web application created with full CRUD operations
✓ All tables have Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality:
  - USER: Full CRUD
  - CAREGIVER: Full CRUD
  - MEMBER: Full CRUD
  - ADDRESS: Full CRUD
  - JOB: Full CRUD
  - JOB_APPLICATION: Create, Read, Delete (composite key)
  - APPOINTMENT: Full CRUD
✓ Modern, responsive web interface with clean design
✓ Navigation between all entities
✓ Form validation and error handling
✓ Flash messages for user feedback
✓ Application ready for deployment

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Database: PostgreSQL
- All foreign key relationships properly defined with CASCADE deletes
- Data types appropriately chosen (SERIAL for auto-increment, DECIMAL for rates, etc.)
- Constraints ensure data integrity

Python Implementation:
- SQLAlchemy used for database connectivity
- Textual SQL approach for maximum flexibility
- Proper session management and error handling
- Code is well-documented and organized

Web Application:
- Flask framework for web development
- Template-based rendering (Jinja2)
- RESTful routing structure
- User-friendly forms and tables
- Responsive design with modern CSS

UNIQUE FEATURES AND DESIGN DECISIONS

1. Data Design:
   - Realistic data with Kazakh names and cities (Astana, Almaty, etc.)
   - Proper relationships between entities
   - Data ensures all queries return meaningful results

2. Schema Enhancements:
   - Added CHECK constraints for data validation
   - Proper use of CASCADE deletes for referential integrity
   - Unique constraints where appropriate (email)

3. Web Application:
   - Intuitive navigation with consistent design
   - Flash messages for user feedback
   - Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
   - Proper form handling with validation

WHAT WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

All three parts of the assignment have been fully implemented:
- Database schema is complete and functional
- All queries execute correctly and return expected results
- Web application provides full CRUD operations for all entities
- Code is well-organized, documented, and ready for deployment
- All files required for submission are present

WHAT COULD BE ENHANCED (Future Improvements)

1. Authentication System: Currently no user authentication - could add login/logout
2. Search Functionality: Could add advanced search filters for caregivers/jobs
3. File Upload: Photo upload functionality for caregivers
4. Email Notifications: Automated emails for appointment confirmations
5. Rating System: Allow members to rate caregivers after appointments
6. Payment Integration: Handle payments through the platform
7. Advanced UI: More interactive features, charts, and analytics
8. API Endpoints: RESTful API for mobile app integration

However, all core requirements as specified in the assignment have been successfully completed.

SUBMISSION READY

✓ schema.sql - Database schema and data
✓ database_queries.py - All Part 2 queries
✓ app.py - Flask web application
✓ requirements.txt - Python dependencies
✓ executive_summary.txt - This document
✓ README.md - Setup and usage instructions
✓ All templates for web application

The project is complete and ready for submission. All requirements have been met, and the implementation is unique, well-structured, and functional.
